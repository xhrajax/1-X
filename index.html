	<p>These parameters are listed: QL date, age, level, current fp, % completion.</p>

	<p>For now data is ordered by players rank. I did not add dates of newly raised GBs.</p>

	<p>Get the file by clicking on this link <a href="2017-01-11-obs-atom-arc.xlsx" download="2017-01-11-obs-atom-arc.xlsx">OBS Atom Arc Data</a></p>

	<p>This is an excel file with xlsx extension. You can use google docs to open the file: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets</a></p>

	<p>Using these data, I want to create another list making a queue. We will use this queue to target them. Of course GvG need will override the queue. But mostly we go by this queue.</p>

	<p>Group A: Those GBs which did not get leveled up after PKA left will have top priority.</p>

	<p>Group B: Then I add new GBs to the list.</p>

	<p>Now how do I order them? We will have following parameters: QL date, age, level, current fp, % completion.</p>
